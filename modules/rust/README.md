### Run Instructions

- install rust nightly
This can be done by running the rustup install script
```
rustup set nightly
rustup default nightly
```
- install pip dependencies (use a virtual env!)
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the following

```
python ./setup develop
python Main.py
```

### Todo
- Document better
- Render things
- Docement how I got this working because the 
py03 and setuptools documentation could use some 
work
